# Stone-Paper-Siccor-Game-with-C

It is a simple Stone-Paper-Scissor game, that we used to play as a child.
Rules are simple:
     *You choose number of rounds
     *If you win a round +1 is added to your score
     *Similarly if you loose a round 1 is deducted from your score, 0 is awarded for a tie
     *At least your and computer's score is calculated, one with higher number wins the game
